codeigniter-gearman-library

This is a library to use gearman within codeigniter.  The original source was pulled from Aniruddha Kale here 
http://codeigniter.com/wiki/Gearman/

I created this repository to track the changes I make to the gearman library here. 

Feel free to pull this rep and make your own. 

Examples of use
$this->load->library('gearman_library');
$this->gearman_library->gearman_client();
$this->gearman_library->do_job_background('identifier',serialize($params));
